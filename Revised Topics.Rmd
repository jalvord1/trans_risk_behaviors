####Research Question

This project will compare the HIV risk among groups of transgender people (transgender men, transgender women, and gender non-conforming people) and also their level of risk versus cisgender people.

Studies have shown that various minority groups are at higher risk for unhealthy behaviors in general and HIV risk specifically. However, there is a current lack of analysis for transgender people in this field.

We strongly believe it will be important to differentiate the results between trans women, trans men, and gender non-comforming people, as there are likely different behavioral patterns, and we do not want to group them together strictly because they are trans. This is a problem we have seen throughout much research in the LGBTQ+ community, where the community is grouped together when it would likely be important to specify sexuality/gender.

In this research, we hope to look just as much at social determinants as we do health behaviors because we believe they will be equally as important.
